But the ancient enemy that killed the gate builders is awake, and the war against our universe has begun again. In the dead system of Adro, Elvi Okoye leads a desperate scientific mission to understand what the gate builders were and what destroyed them, even if it means compromising herself and the half-alien children who bear the weight of her investigation.

Demonstrating, once again, her gift for spellbinding storytelling and the creation of legend, Anne Rice makes real for us a great dynasty of witches--a family given to poetry and to incest, to murder and to philosophy; a family that, over the ages, is itself haunted by a powerful, dangerous, and seductive being. On the veranda of a great New Orleans house, now faded, a mute and fragile woman sits rocking . . . and The Witching Hour begins. It begins in our time with a rescue at sea. Rowan Mayfair, a beautiful woman, a brilliant practitioner of neurosurgery--aware that she has special powers but unaware that she comes from an ancient line of witches--finds the drowned body of a man off the coast of California and brings him to life. He is Michael Curry, who was born in New Orleans and orphaned in childhood by fire on Christmas Eve, who pulled himself up from poverty, and who now, in his brief interval of death, has acquired a sensory power that mystifies and frightens him. As these two, fiercely drawn to each other, fall in love and--in passionate alliance--set out to solve the mystery of her past and his unwelcome gift, the novel moves backward and forward in time from today's New Orleans and San Francisco to long-ago Amsterdam and a château in the France of Louis XIV. An intricate tale of evil unfolds--an evil unleashed in seventeenth-century Scotland, where the first \"witch,\" Suzanne of the Mayfair, conjures up the spirit she names Lasher . . . a creation that spells her own destruction and torments each of her descendants in turn. From the coffee plantations of Port au Prince, where the great Mayfair fortune is made and the legacy of their dark power is almost destroyed, to Civil War New Orleans, as Julien--the clan's only male to be endowed with occult powers--provides for the dynasty its foothold in America, the dark, luminous story encompasses dramas of seduction and death, episodes of tenderness and healing. And always--through peril and escape, tension and release--there swirl around us the echoes of eternal war: innocence versus the corruption of the spirit, sanity against madness, life against death. With a dreamlike power, the novel draws us, through circuitous, twilight paths, to the present and Rowan's increasingly inspired and risky moves in the merciless game that binds her to her heritage. And in New Orleans, on Christmas Eve, this strangest of family sagas is brought to its startling climax.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=hFT7yV3zAeUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2010-11-17T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:18.159Z"],[46],{"id":39,"bookId":39,"authorId":39,"author":47},{"id":39,"name":48,"dateCreated":49},"Anne Rice",["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:18.150Z"],[51],{"id":39,"bookId":39,"bookCategoryId":21,"bookCategory":52},{"id":21,"category":36,"dateCreated":53},["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:00.906Z"],{"id":55,"title":56,"subtitle":57,"description":58,"thumbnail":59,"publishedDate":60,"dateCreated":61,"authors":62,"categories":67},4,"The Song of Achilles","A Novel","“At once a scholar’s homage to The Iliad and startlingly original work of art by an incredibly talented new novelist….A book I could not put down.” —Ann Patchett “Mary Renault lives again!” declares Emma Donoghue, author of Room, referring to The Song of Achilles, Madeline Miller’s thrilling, profoundly moving, and utterly unique retelling of the legend of Achilles and the Trojan War.

In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child -- not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power -- the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world. #1 New York Times Bestseller -- named one of the Best Books of the Year by NPR, the Washington Post, People, Time, Amazon, Entertainment Weekly, Bustle, Newsweek, the A.V.

Spensa’s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krell—the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. What’s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home. Now, the Superiority—the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human life—has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensa’s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator. Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if she’s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy. The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return. To have courage means facing fear.

In Norse Mythology, Gaiman stays true to the myths in envisioning the major Norse pantheon: Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki—son of a giant—blood brother to Odin and a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. Gaiman fashions these primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds and delves into the exploits of deities, dwarfs, and giants. Through Gaiman’s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ft2NDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2017-02-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-12-26T23:27:38.898Z"],[175],{"id":168,"bookId":168,"authorId":137,"author":176},{"id":137,"name":177,"dateCreated":178},"Neil Gaiman",["Date","2022-12-26T23:27:38.889Z"],[180],{"id":168,"bookId":168,"bookCategoryId":21,"bookCategory":181},{"id":21,"category":36,"dateCreated":182},["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:00.906Z"],{"id":184,"title":185,"subtitle":23,"description":186,"thumbnail":187,"publishedDate":188,"dateCreated":189,"authors":190,"categories":195},12,"The Innocent Mage","\"The Innocent Mage is come, and we stand at the beginning of the end of everything.\" Being a fisherman like his father isn't a bad life, but it's not the one that Asher wants.

Now fully revised and updated, this educational edition includes chapter summaries, comprehension questions, discussion points, classroom activities, a biographical profile of Golding, historical context relevant to the novel and an essay on Lord of the Flies by William Golding entitled 'Fable'.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work. It will change the way you think about thinking. Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent. Kahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives--and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=TA7Q27RWlj0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2011-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-12-26T23:29:05.131Z"],[271],{"id":264,"bookId":264,"authorId":184,"author":272},{"id":184,"name":273,"dateCreated":274},"Daniel Kahneman",["Date","2022-12-26T23:29:05.121Z"],[276],{"id":264,"bookId":264,"bookCategoryId":72,"bookCategory":277},{"id":72,"category":278,"dateCreated":279},"Psychology",["Date","2022-12-26T23:29:05.127Z"],{"id":281,"title":282,"subtitle":23,"description":283,"thumbnail":284,"publishedDate":285,"dateCreated":286,"authors":287,"categories":292},18,"Ghost Story","It began shortly after the party at which one of their members, Edward Wanderley, had died - or was killed.

Yet no one knows the true story; their confessions have never been found. Until now. Reeling from heartbreak, a scholar named Dr. Voth discovers a long-lost manuscript—a gender-defying exposé of Jack and Bess’s adventures. Is Confessions of the Fox an authentic autobiography or a hoax? As Dr. Voth is drawn deeper into Jack and Bess’s tale of underworld resistance and gender transformation, it becomes clear that their fates are intertwined—and only a miracle will save them all. Writing with the narrative mastery of Sarah Waters and the playful imagination of Nabokov, Jordy Rosenberg is an audacious storyteller of extraordinary talent.

Among the victims are the wife and two daughters of Joe Carpenter, a Los Angeles Post crime reporter. A year after the crash, still gripped by an almost paralyzing grief, Joe encounters a woman named Rose, who claims to have survived the crash. She holds out the possibility of a secret that will bring Joe peace of mind. But before he can ask any questions, she slips away. Driven now by rage (have the authorities withheld information?) and a hope almost as unbearable as his grief (if there is one survivor, are there others?), Joe sets out to find the mysterious woman. His search immediately leads him into the path of a powerful and shadowy organization hell-bent on stopping Rose before she can reveal what she knows about the crash. Sole Survivor unfolds at a heart-stopping pace, as a desperate chase and a shattering emotional odyssey lead Joe to a truth that will force him to reassess everything he thought he knew about life and death -- a truth that, given the chance, will rock the world and redefine the destiny of humanity.

From the bestselling author of The Dark Side, an electrifying work of investigative journalism that uncovers the agenda of this powerful group. In her new preface, Jane Mayer discusses the results of the most recent election and Donald Trump's victory, and how, despite much discussion to the contrary, this was a huge victory for the billionaires who have been pouring money in the American political system. Why is America living in an age of profound and widening economic inequality? Why have even modest attempts to address climate change been defeated again and again? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers? In a riveting and indelible feat of reporting, Jane Mayer illuminates the history of an elite cadre of plutocrats—headed by the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Olins, and the Bradleys—who have bankrolled a systematic plan to fundamentally alter the American political system. Mayer traces a byzantine trail of billions of dollars spent by the network, revealing a staggering conglomeration of think tanks, academic institutions, media groups, courthouses, and government allies that have fallen under their sphere of influence. Drawing from hundreds of exclusive interviews, as well as extensive scrutiny of public records, private papers, and court proceedings, Mayer provides vivid portraits of the secretive figures behind the new American oligarchy and a searing look at the carefully concealed agendas steering the nation. Dark Money is an essential book for anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.

A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector. A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s—1Q84 is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=CPPxMXgaKhAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2011-10-25T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-12-26T23:30:47.335Z"],[418],{"id":411,"bookId":411,"authorId":298,"author":419},{"id":298,"name":420,"dateCreated":421},"Haruki Murakami",["Date","2022-12-26T23:30:47.325Z"],[423],{"id":411,"bookId":411,"bookCategoryId":21,"bookCategory":424},{"id":21,"category":36,"dateCreated":425},["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:00.906Z"],{"id":427,"title":428,"subtitle":57,"description":429,"thumbnail":430,"publishedDate":431,"dateCreated":432,"authors":433,"categories":438},27,"The Grace Year","The Instant New York Times Bestseller!

That’s why they’re banished for their sixteenth year, to release their magic into the wild so they can return purified and ready for marriage. But not all of them will make it home alive. Sixteen-year-old Tierney James dreams of a better life—a society that doesn’t pit friend against friend or woman against woman, but as her own grace year draws near, she quickly realizes that it’s not just the brutal elements they must fear. It’s not even the poachers in the woods, men who are waiting for a chance to grab one of the girls in order to make a fortune on the black market. Their greatest threat may very well be each other. With sharp prose and gritty realism, The Grace Year examines the complex and sometimes twisted relationships between girls, the women they eventually become, and the difficult decisions they make in-between.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=i0mDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2019-10-08T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-12-26T23:30:55.965Z"],[434],{"id":427,"bookId":427,"authorId":313,"author":435},{"id":313,"name":436,"dateCreated":437},"Kim Liggett",["Date","2022-12-26T23:30:55.953Z"],[439],{"id":427,"bookId":427,"bookCategoryId":39,"bookCategory":440},{"id":39,"category":101,"dateCreated":441},["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:51.713Z"],{"id":443,"title":444,"subtitle":445,"description":446,"thumbnail":447,"publishedDate":448,"dateCreated":449,"authors":450,"categories":455},28,"Cribsheet","A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool","Parenting is full of decisions, nearly all of which can be agonized over. There is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and strangers on the internet. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the trade-offs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision? Armed with the data, Oster finds that the conventional wisdom doesn't always hold up. She debunks myths and offers non-judgemental ways to consider our options in light of the facts. She also shows parents how to think through freighted questions like if and how to go back to work, how to think about toddler discipline, and how to have a relationship and parent at the same time. Cribsheet is a thinking parent's guide that empowers us to make better, less fraught decisions - and stay sane in the years before preschool.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=ba-RyQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api",["Date","2020-04-02T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2022-12-26T23:31:02.461Z"],[451],{"id":443,"bookId":443,"authorId":329,"author":452},{"id":329,"name":453,"dateCreated":454},"Emily Oster",["Date","2022-12-26T23:31:02.446Z"],[456],{"id":443,"bookId":443,"bookCategoryId":120,"bookCategory":457},{"id":120,"category":458,"dateCreated":459},"Parenting",["Date","2022-12-26T23:31:02.454Z"],{"id":461,"title":462,"subtitle":23,"description":463,"thumbnail":464,"publishedDate":465,"dateCreated":466,"authors":467,"categories":472},29,"Snow Crash","\"This Snow Crash thing--is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?\" Juanita shrugs. \"What's the difference?\" The only relief from the sea of logos is within the well-guarded borders of the Burbclaves. Is it any wonder that most sane folks have forsaken the real world and chosen to live in the computer-generated universe of virtual reality? In a major city, the size of a dozen Manhattans, is a domain of pleasures limited only by the imagination. But now a strange new computer virus called Snow Crash is striking down hackers everywhere, leaving an unlikely young pizza delivery man as humankind's last best hope. The perfect cyberpunk sci-fi read, Snow Crash is an equally worthy successor to William Gibson's Neuromancer and predecessor to Ernest Cline's Ready Player One. *** What readers are saying about Snow Crash: 'It's hard to believe Neal wrote his books when the published date claims. He's always so right about the future, and I keep on hoping he's so wrong' Goodreads Reader Review 'Snow Crash is to Books as The Matrix is to movies (with only the absolute BEST parts of Tron and Da Vinci Code thrown in)' Goodreads Reader Review 'Loved it! Can't recommend it highly enough. Everyone should read this book. Go do it. Do it now. It's just awesome. You won't regret it' Goodreads Reader Review 'It's hilarious and mind-blowing.
