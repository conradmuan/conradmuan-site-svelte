Hardly anyone thinks they really exist. A kandra researcher has returned to Elendel with images that seem to depict the Bands, as well as writings in a language that no one can read. Waxillium Ladrian is recruited to travel south to the city of New Seran to investigate. Along the way he discovers hints that point to the true goals of his uncle Edwarn and the shadowy organization known as The Set.Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson The Cosmere The Stormlight Archive The Way of Kings Words of Radiance Edgedancer (Novella) Oathbringer Dawnshard (Novella) Rhythm of War The Mistborn trilogy Mistborn: The Final Empire The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series Alloy of Law Shadows of Self Bands of Mourning The Lost Metal Collection Arcanum Unbounded Other Cosmere novels Elantris Warbreaker The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians The Scrivener's Bones The Knights of Crystallia The Shattered Lens The Dark Talent The Rithmatist series The Rithmatist Other books by Brandon Sanderson The Reckoners Steelheart Firefight Calamity","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=sYtVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api",["Date","2023-09-05T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-01-02T18:47:13.053Z"],[19],{"id":11,"bookId":11,"authorId":20,"author":21},5,{"id":20,"name":22,"dateCreated":23},"Brandon Sanderson",["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:51.706Z"],[25],{"id":11,"bookId":11,"bookCategoryId":3,"bookCategory":26},{"id":3,"category":27,"dateCreated":28},"Fiction",["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:00.906Z"]],"uses":{}}]}
