Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher—for that world or ours. Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was seven, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from it. Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world. King’s storytelling in Fairy Tale soars. This is a magnificent and terrifying tale in which good is pitted against overwhelming evil, and a heroic boy—and his dog—must lead the battle. Early in the Pandemic, King asked himself: “What could you write that would make you happy?” “As if my imagination had been waiting for the question to be asked, I saw a vast deserted city—deserted but alive. I saw the empty streets, the haunted buildings, a gargoyle head lying overturned in the street. I saw smashed statues (of what I didn’t know, but I eventually found out). I saw a huge, sprawling palace with glass towers so high their tips pierced the clouds. Those images released the story I wanted to tell.”","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=-GFaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2022-09-06T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-02-01T18:52:11.040Z"],[115],{"id":108,"bookId":108,"authorId":116,"author":117},1,{"id":116,"name":118,"dateCreated":119},"Stephen King",["Date","2022-12-26T23:25:48.113Z"],[121],{"id":108,"bookId":108,"bookCategoryId":18,"bookCategory":122},{"id":18,"category":20,"dateCreated":123},["Date","2022-12-26T23:26:00.906Z"],{"id":125,"title":126,"subtitle":127,"description":128,"thumbnail":129,"publishedDate":130,"dateCreated":131,"authors":132,"categories":136},40,"Tress of the Emerald Sea","A Cosmere Novel","#1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson expands his Cosmere universe shared by The Stormlight Archive and Mistborn with a new standalone novel for everyone who loved The Princess Bride.

Lillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and they’ve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help. Madison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, there’s a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but it’s the truth. Thinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each other—and stay cool—while also staying out of the way of Madison’s buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need her—urgently and fiercely. Couldn’t this be the start of the amazing life she’d always hoped for?

Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2008-12-03T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-05-01T05:48:27.936Z"],[234],{"id":226,"bookId":226,"authorId":3,"author":235},{"id":3,"name":236,"dateCreated":237},"Donella Meadows",["Date","2023-05-01T05:48:27.922Z"],[239],{"id":226,"bookId":226,"bookCategoryId":240,"bookCategory":241},10,{"id":240,"category":242,"dateCreated":243},"Science",["Date","2023-05-01T05:48:27.930Z"],{"id":245,"title":246,"subtitle":40,"description":247,"thumbnail":248,"publishedDate":249,"dateCreated":250,"authors":251,"categories":256},47,"Redshirts","Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship Intrepid, flagship of the Universal Union since the year 2456.

But what he's found is far more dangerous than he ever imagined. Dr. Tyson Klein is a quantum physicist who has dedicated his entire life to his research. At CERN, he analyses data generated by the Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. Now, Ty believes he's found a pattern in its output. It looks like an organised data stream, being broadcast over what he calls a quantum radio. Could it be a signal from another universe? A message sent from the future? Or something else entirely? As Ty peels back the layers of his discovery, he learns that what he's found isn't what he thought it was. The encoded message is far more profound. It may alter our understanding of human existence and the universe. But Ty is not the only one looking for it. Someone has been following his research for a long time. And they'll do anything to prevent him from unravelling what is being broadcast by the quantum radio... Because the first one to discover the truth may well control the future.","http:\u002F\u002Fbooks.google.com\u002Fbooks\u002Fcontent?id=0QGfEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",["Date","2023-03-02T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-05-01T05:49:33.977Z"],[270],{"id":263,"bookId":263,"authorId":38,"author":271},{"id":38,"name":272,"dateCreated":273},"A.G.
